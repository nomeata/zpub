# zpub


zpub is a server to collaboratively work on DocBook-based documentation.
Editors modify the XML sources with their preferred editor and submit their
changes via Subversion. zpub renders the files centrally to various output
formats, optionally notifies other editors, provides an archive of all previous
revisions of the document, and supports a simple sign-off workflow.

zpub is based on Free Software components and itself released as Free Software.
