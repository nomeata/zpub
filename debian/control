Description: collaborative DocBook editing server
 zpub is a server to collaboratively work on DocBook-based documentation.
 Editors modify the XML sources with their preferred editor and submit their
 changes via Subversion. zpub renders the files centrally to various output
 formats, optionally notifies other editors, provides an archive of all
 previous revisions of the document, and supports a simple sign-off workflow.
 The documentation and user interface is currently only available in German.
